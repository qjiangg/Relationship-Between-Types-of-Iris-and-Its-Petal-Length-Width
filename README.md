# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Project Overview

The **Iris Flower Classification Project** aims to classify iris flower species based on their physical characteristics, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project uses machine learning techniques, specifically Softmax regression, to predict the species of iris flowers from the famous **Iris dataset**. The analysis leverages Python libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to preprocess data, build models, visualize results, and evaluate model performance.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned the Iris dataset, handled missing values, and performed factor encoding to prepare the data for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the relationships between different features and identify patterns in the dataset.
- **Modeling:** Applied Softmax regression using Scikit-learn to predict the species of iris flowers.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Performance Tuning:** Optimized the model by adjusting hyperparameters and performing cross-validation.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-classification.git
   ```

2. **Install required libraries:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook:**
   - Open the `Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - Execute the notebook cells sequentially to perform data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Iris dataset**, which contains data about 150 iris flowers, classified into three species:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

The dataset includes the following features:

- **Sepal Length**: Length of the sepal (cm)
- **Sepal Width**: Width of the sepal (cm)
- **Petal Length**: Length of the petal (cm)
- **Petal Width**: Width of the petal (cm)
- **Species**: The species of the iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Results

- **Achieved 93.3% accuracy** in classifying the iris species using Softmax regression.
- **Key Features:** Petal length and petal width were found to be the most influential features in determining the species.
- **Model Performance:** The Softmax regression model performed well with high accuracy and precision in predicting the species.

## Conclusion

The **Iris Flower Classification** project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to classify flowers based on their physical features. By utilizing Softmax regression, the project achieved strong predictive performance, offering valuable insights into the relationship between flower characteristics and species classification.
